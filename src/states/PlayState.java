/**
 * This state represents the Playing State of the Game The main responsibility
 * of this class is to; - create Game Objects - update Game Objects - draw Game
 * Objects Game Objects are for instance; players, enemies, npc's, etc...
 *
 * The PlayState can also be thought off as a blue print where data is loaded
 * into some container from a file or some other type of data storage.
 *
 * It can also be created by some class responsible for object creation and then
 * passed to the PlayState as a parameter. This means all the PlayState has to
 * do is receive a list of objects, store them in some container and then for
 * every object in that container update and render that object.
 *
 * This way you can let the user define different Levels based on what
 * parameters are passed into the PlayState.
